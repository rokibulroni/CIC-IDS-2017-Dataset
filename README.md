# Phishing Email Forensic Framework & CIC-IDS-2017 PCAP Datasets Repository

This repository hosts open-source datasets and resources essential for analyzing phishing email patterns, developing forensic frameworks, and studying network traffic. These datasets are derived from the **CICDataset/CIC-IDS-2017**, a freely available DDoS traffic dataset from the **Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC)**. These resources are ideal for building and testing models for phishing detection, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and cybersecurity threat intelligence.
